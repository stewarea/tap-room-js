Tap Room App
Build a small Angular app for a bar to keep track of their kegs. Use the To-Do List homework as a guide. Look for relationships between the various parts of this program and the parts of the To-Do List.

Here are some user stories to get you started. As a bartender ...

I want to fill out a form when I tap a new keg to create a display for it.
I want to see what kegs I have available. For each keg, I need to see its name, brand, price and alcohol content.
I want to see a display of how many pints are left in a keg. A full keg has 124 pints in it.. I want to be able to click a button on a display of a keg whenever I sell a pint of that kind of beer and have the display of how many pints are left decrease by 1.
I want to be able to see all the kegs that have less than 10 pints left so that I can be ready to change them.
I want to be able to edit a keg's properties after entering them.
I want to have kegs color coded to show me at a glance if they are cheap or expensive - say greater or less than $5 per pint. I also want to use the alcohol content property to display stronger beers differently than weaker beers.
Further Exploration

If you have finished all objectives above, you can get some more practice with your TypeScript To-Do List (the non-angular one) by adding the following functions to your to-do-listing-functions.ts file with a way to trigger them and display the results on the front-end of your app:

Sort tasks to only show tasks of a given type (hobby/work/home)
List all tasks that are of a given priority.
Display the first, high priority task for the given person.
